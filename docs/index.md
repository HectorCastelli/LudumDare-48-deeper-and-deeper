This is my submission for #LD48.

My initial idea was somewhat different from this, but after prototyping it did not feel good to play.

I had to switch from 3rd person view to 1st person, and that took more time than I expected, since the movement felt off.

For the sake of finishing the game, I opted out of procedural generation, and created a couple of levels (cave "levels", not actual levels) by hand. For a longer version of this, I would have liked to use procedural generation to make 100-ish level before any major encounter.

Another feature that was cut was graplign and boss-fights. I wanted to have grapling as a main tool to traverse the levels and use it as a last-resort for situations where you fall off. I also wanted to have boss fights ever 30 or so levels so the player can have some challenge besides the platforming.
